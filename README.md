# outgassing-calc
The outgassing calculator app i created during my nasa jpl internship

To determine whether a material is viable for use in space it has to have its outgassing properties tested.
Outgassing is essentially how much material evaporates from a given material when in  a vacuum, heat or both.
This test produces a lot of raw data that is somewhat difficult to parse through by hand so i created this simple gui that allows people to use the standard
  output files from the machine so that it takes as little effort as possible from the operator.
 It's is hopefully pretty fool proof but its also my first ever full application so it's pretty barebones and low tech.
